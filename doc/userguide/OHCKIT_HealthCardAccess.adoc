[#HealthCardAccess]
=== HealthCardAccess
This library contains the classes for cards, commands, card file systems and error handling.

==== HealthCardAccess API

The HealthCardAccessKit API Structure contains the `HealthCard` class representing all supported card types,
the `Commands` and `Responses` groups with all supported commands and responses for health cards,
the `CardObjects` group with the possible objects on a health cards
and the `Operation` group for cascading and executing commands on health cards.

===== Health Cards
The class `HealthCard` represents the potential types of health cards by storing a `HealthCardStatus` property which in
case of being _valid_ by itself stores a `HealthCardPropertyType` which at the time of writing is represented by either
one of the following

- egk ("elektronische Gesundheitskarte")
- hba ("Heilberufeausweis")
- smcb ("Security Module Card Typ B").

The `HealthCardPropertyType` by itself stores the `CardGeneration` (G1, G1P, G2, G2.1) as well.

Furthermore the `HealthCard` object contains the physical card from a card reader and the current card channel.

===== Commands

The `Commands` groups contains all available `HealthCardCommand` objects for health cards through the `HealthCardCommandBuilder`.


==== Code Samples

===== Create a command
The design of this API follows the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern[command design pattern]
leveraging Swift's https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/[Combine Framework].
The command objects are designed to fulfil the use-cases described in the link:https://www.vesta-gematik.de/standards/detail/standards/spezifikation-des-card-operating-system-cos-elektrische-schnittstelle-1/[Gematik COS specification].
After creating a command object resp. sequence you can execute it on a Healthcard with the help of `publisher(for:)`.
More information on how to configure the commands can also be found in the Gematik COS specification.

Following example shall send a +SELECT+ and a +READ+ command to a smart card
in order to select and read the certificate stored in the file +EF.C.CH.AUT.R2048+ in the application +ESIGN+.

First we want to to create a `SelectCommand` object passing a `ApplicationIdentifier`. We use one of the predefined
helper functions by using `HealthCardCommand.Select`.

One could also use the `HealthCardCommandBuilder` to construct a customized `HealthCardCommand`
by setting the APDU-bytes manually.

===== Setting an execution target

We execute the created command `CardType` instance which has been typically provided by a `CardReaderType`.

In the next example we use a `HealthCard` object representing an eGK (elektronische Gesundheitskarte)
as one kind of a `HealthCardType` implementing the `CardType` protocol.

A created command can be lifted to the Combine framework with `publisher(for:writetimeout:readtimeout)`.
The result of the command execution can be validated against an expected `ResponseStatus`,
e.g. +SUCCESS+ (+0x9000+).

===== Create a Command Sequence

It is possible to chain further commands via the `flatMap` operator for subsequent execution:
First create a command and lift it onto a Combine monad, then create a publisher using the `flatMap` operator, e.g.

```
Just(AnyHealthCardCommand.build())
    .flatMap { command in command.pusblisher(for: card) }
```

Eventually use `eraseToAnyPublisher()`.

===== Process Execution result

When the whole command chain is set up we have to subscribe to it.
We really only will receive one value before completion, so something as simple as this `sink()`
convenience publisher is useful.
