== Getting Started

OpenHealthCardKit requires Swift 5.6.

=== Setup for integration

- **Swift Package Manager:** Put this in your `Package.swift`:

    .package(url: "https://github.com/gematik/ref-OpenHealthCardKit", from: "5.6.0"),

- **Carthage:** Put this in your `Cartfile`:

    github "gematik/ref-openHealthCardKit" ~> 5.0

=== Setup for development

Run `$ make setup` to start developing locally. This will make sure all the dependencies are put in place and the Xcode-project will be generated and/or overwritten.

Dependencies are a mix of SPM (Swift Package Manager) and Carthage right now. The Xcode-project is generated using `xcodegen`.
The more complex build configuration(s) is done with the help of Fastlane. See the `./fastlane` directory for full setup.
