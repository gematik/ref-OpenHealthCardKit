= CardSimulationTestKit

NOTE: This framework rather is meant to be used for gematik-internal development purposes (since the actual CardSimulation application can neither be open sourced nor provided as of now). We publish this code anyway for further reference/usage.

CardSimulationTestKit provides an easy-to-use interface for testing against a German Health Card Simulator.
It comes bundled with

* `CardSimulationLoader`: loads and starts a card simulation as a Java process listening on a TCP port
* `CardSimulationCardReaderProvider`: implements the `CardReaderProviderApi` interface
* `CardSimulationTerminalTestCase`: provides a fully initialized and functional `HealthCard` object to send commands to and receive responses from.


The intended usage of this project is to ease integration and use the G2-Kartensimulation with Swift projects, specifically the test cases in this project.
This guide is separated in two (2) main parts. Describing

. the usage of the `CardSimulation-Loader` framework (How-to) and
. how to maintain the technical consideration(s) and implementation(s).

== Frameworks

=== CardSimulation-Loader

The sole purpose of this framework is to launch and monitor a G2-Kartensimulation Java process.
For detailed usage information see the inlined documentation on `SimulationManager`
and `SimulationRunner`.

*Starting the simulator*:

Of course the best way to find out how-to use the CardSimulation-Loader is by checking the `SimulationManagerTest` and `SimulationRunnerTest` to see their intended and tested use-cases.
Next to checking the test-cases you also find some (example) configuration files in the _Configuration.bundle_ file.

In general, you would prepare such a *card-configuration* XML as in the Configuration.bundle and pass it to the `SimulationManager.shared` by invoking its:

[source,Swift]
----
func createSimulation(
  configFile: URL,
  preprocessor manipulators: [XMLPathManipulator] = [],
  simulatorVersion: String = "2.7.6-352",
  simulatorDirectory: String = "simulator",
)
----

Note: you can specify the G2-Kartensimulation version it needs to download/use.

The returned `SimulationRunnerType` can be used to monitor the newly started G2-Kartensimulation instance. To - for instance - figure out on which TLV-port the simulator is registered, just check the `SimulationRunnerType.mode`. When `running` the TLV TCP/IP port is projected there. And for convenience reasons made available through `var tlvPort: Int?` on SimulationRunnerType(s).

This SimulationRunnerType instance will need a CardTerminalControllerType to expose this G2-Kartensimulation virtual `HealthCard` to the HealthCardAccess/Control realm.

*Example*:

[source,Swift]
----
/// Read configFile from included Resources Bundle
let simulatorConfig = Bundle(for: MyClass.self)
  .resourceFilePath(in: "Configuration", for: "configuration_EGKG2_80276883110000017222_gema5_TCP.xml")
  .asURL
/// Launch a G2-Kartensimulation with this configuration file
let runner = try SimulationManager.shared.startSimulation(
  configFile: simulatorConfig,
  preprocessor: [
    XMLPathManipulatorHolder.TLVPortManipulator(port: "0"),
    XMLPathManipulatorHolder.RelativeToAbsolutePathManipulator(with: XMLPathManipulatorHolder.CardConfigFileXMLPath, absolutePath: simulatorConfig.deletingLastPathComponent()),
    XMLPathManipulatorHolder.RelativeToAbsolutePathManipulator(with: XMLPathManipulatorHolder.ChannelConfigFileXMLPath, absolutePath: simulatorConfig.deletingLastPathComponent())
  ],
  waitUntilLaunched: true
)

// ... Do amazing things with the runner

/// Stop the runner when done
runner.stop(waitUntilTerminated: true)
----

==== Technical overview

As described in the previous section(s) the CardSimulationLoader provides an easy-to-use API to launch and manage a G2-Kartensimulation.
In order to achieve this we need to combine some various technologies/environments (read: Nexus <--> Java <--> Swift -> CardSimulationLoader API).

The main components for this project to work:

* Download G2-Kartensimulation Nexus artifacts
* Launch and monitor Java Process

These two (2) steps are taken care of when using the `SimulationManager` to launch a simulation.

==== Maven step

The `SimulationManager` reads the `pom.xml` and executes a shell script to run `mvn dependency:copy-dependencies`.
And puts these artifacts in the same transient environment to be cleaned (manually) by calling `SimulationManager.clean` upon
finishing with the simulator(s). Reason for this is to not download the artifacts for every simulator instance in case they
are launch sequentially - which is reasonable to assume.

==== Java process

When the artifacts are in place, the `SimulationRunner` creates a JavaProcess that will be launched/forked in a separate process.
And monitors this process by reading/parsing the `stdout` and `stderr` to detect the tlv-port number and successful initialization.

To start developing the project follow the Project Setup section below ðŸ‘‡.

=== CardSimulation-CardReaderProvider

CardTerminalProvider for communication with G2-Kartensimulation

=== CardSimulationTerminalTestCase

CardSimulationTerminalTestCase provides a fully initialized and functional `HealthCard` object to send commands
against and receive responses from.

== Getting Started

CardSimulationLoader requires Swift 5.1.

=== Usage

In your Test class, derive from the `CardSimulationTerminalTestCase` which itself is a `XCTestCase`.
You then have a `HealthCard` and a `CardTerminal` object directly link to an up and running CardSimulation at your disposal.

[source,Swift]
----
final class SelectCommandIntegrationTest: CardSimulationTerminalTestCase {
    func testSelectRoot() {
        let healthCard = CardSimulationTerminalTestCase.healthCard
        HealthCardCommand.Select.selectRoot()
                .execute(on: healthCard)
                .run(on: Executor.trampoline)
    }
}
----

CardSimulationTestKit comes with various CardImage configuration files.
You can choose between the following images

* configuration_EGK_G2_1_80276883110000095711_GuD_TCP.xml (default)
* configuration_EGK_G2_1_ecc.xml
* configuration_EGKG2_80276883110000017222_gema5_TCP.xml
* configuration_HBA_G2_1_80276883110000205690_gema5_TCP.xml
* configuration_HBAG2_80276883110000017289_gema5_TCP.xml
* configuration_TLK_COS_image-kontaktlos128.xml

by overwriting the `class func configFile() -> URL?` like this:

[source,Swift]
----
final class SelectCommandIntegrationTest: CardSimulationTerminalTestCase {
    override class func configFile() -> URL? {
        let bundle = Bundle(for: CardSimulationTerminalTestCase.self)
        let path = bundle.resourceFilePath(in: "Resources", for: "Configuration/configuration_EGK_G2_1_ecc.xml")
        return path.asURL
    }
}
----
or bring your own image:

[source,Swift]
----
final class SelectCommandIntegrationTest: CardSimulationTerminalTestCase {
    override class func configFile() -> URL? {
        // this assumes, your use a test class and have a resource bundle called "Resources2.bundle"
        let bundle = Bundle(for: self)
        let path = bundle.testResourceFilePath(in: "Resources2", for: "Configuration/configuration_EGK_G2_1_ecc.xml")
        return path.asURL
    }
}
