== About The Project

Controlling/Use-case framework for accessing smart cards of the telematic infrastructure.

== Introduction

The OpenHealthCardKit module is intended for reference purposes
when implementing a system that performs the communication between an iOS based mobile device
and a German Health Card (elektronische Gesundheitskarte) using an NFC, Blue Tooth oder USB interface.

This document describes the functionalitiy and structure of OpenHealthCardKit.

== Overview

OpenHealthCardKit bundles submodules that provide the functionality
necessary for accessing and interacting with German Health Cards via a mobile iOS device.

OpenHealthCardKit consists of the submodules

- CardReaderProviderApi
- HealthCardAccess
- HealthCardControl
- NFCCardReaderProvider

As a reference for the usage of each submodule see also the `IntegrationTests`.

=== Release Notes
See `link:../ReleaseNotes.md[ReleaseNotes]` for all information regarding the (newest) releases.

== Getting Started

OpenHealthCardKit requires Swift 5.6.

=== Prerequisites

- Swift 5.6 or later
- Xcode (for iOS development)
- Swift Package Manager, Carthage, or manual integration

=== Installation

==== Swift Package Manager

Put this in your `Package.swift`:

[source,swift]
----
.package(url: "https://github.com/gematik/ref-OpenHealthCardKit", from: "5.6.0"),
----

==== Carthage

Put this in your `Cartfile`:

----
github "gematik/ref-openHealthCardKit" ~> 5.0
----

==== Setup for Development

Run `$ make setup` to start developing locally. This will make sure all the dependencies are put in place and the Xcode-project will be generated and/or overwritten.

Dependencies are a mix of SPM (Swift Package Manager) and Carthage right now. The Xcode-project is generated using `xcodegen`.
The more complex build configuration(s) is done with the help of Fastlane. See the `./fastlane` directory for full setup.

== Usage

== API Documentation

Generated API docs are available at https://swiftpackageindex.com/gematik/ref-OpenHealthCardKit[Swift Package Index]:

* HealthCardControl (tbd)
* https://swiftpackageindex.com/gematik/ref-OpenHealthCardKit/main/documentation/healthcardaccess[HealthCardAccess]
* https://swiftpackageindex.com/gematik/ref-OpenHealthCardKit/main/documentation/nfccardreaderprovider[NFCCardReaderProvider]
* https://swiftpackageindex.com/gematik/ref-OpenHealthCardKit/main/documentation/cardreaderproviderapi[CardReaderProviderApi]

NOTE: As of now the automatic API doc generation for `HealthCardControl` is broken. It's possible to generate it manually via Xcode: Select the target `HealthCardControl` and select `Product -> Build Documentation`.

[#CardReaderProviderApi]
=== CardReaderProviderApi

(Smart)CardReader protocols for interacting with `HealthCardAccess`.

[#HealthCardAccess]
=== HealthCardAccess
This library contains the classes for cards, commands, card file systems and error handling.

==== HealthCardAccess API

The HealthCardAccessKit API Structure contains the `HealthCard` class representing all supported card types,
the `Commands` and `Responses` groups with all supported commands and responses for health cards,
the `CardObjects` group with the possible objects on a health cards
and the `Operation` group for cascading and executing commands on health cards.

===== Health Cards
The class `HealthCard` represents the potential types of health cards by storing a `HealthCardStatus` property which in
case of being _valid_ by itself stores a `HealthCardPropertyType` which at the time of writing is represented by either
one of the following

- egk ("elektronische Gesundheitskarte")
- hba ("Heilberufeausweis")
- smcb ("Security Module Card Typ B").

The `HealthCardPropertyType` by itself stores the `CardGeneration` (G1, G1P, G2, G2.1) as well.

Furthermore the `HealthCard` object contains the physical card from a card reader and the current card channel.

===== Commands

The `Commands` groups contains all available `HealthCardCommand` objects for health cards through the `HealthCardCommandBuilder`.


==== Code Samples

===== Create a command
The design of this API follows the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern[command design pattern]
leveraging Swift's https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/[Combine Framework].
The command objects are designed to fulfil the use-cases described in the link:https://www.vesta-gematik.de/standards/detail/standards/spezifikation-des-card-operating-system-cos-elektrische-schnittstelle-1/[Gematik COS specification].
After creating a command object resp. sequence you can execute it on a Healthcard with the help of `publisher(for:)`.
More information on how to configure the commands can also be found in the Gematik COS specification.

Following example shall send a +SELECT+ and a +READ+ command to a smart card
in order to select and read the certificate stored in the file +EF.C.CH.AUT.R2048+ in the application +ESIGN+.

First we want to to create a `SelectCommand` object passing a `ApplicationIdentifier`. We use one of the predefined
helper functions by using `HealthCardCommand.Select`.

One could also use the `HealthCardCommandBuilder` to construct a customized `HealthCardCommand`
by setting the APDU-bytes manually.

[source,swift]
----
let eSign = EgkFileSystem.DF.ESIGN
let selectEsignCommand = HealthCardCommand.Select.selectFile(with: eSign.aid)
----

===== Command execution

We execute the created command `CardType` instance which has been typically provided by a `CardReaderType`.

In the next example we use a `HealthCard` object representing an eGK (elektronische Gesundheitskarte)
as one kind of a `HealthCardType` implementing the `CardType` protocol and then send the command to the card (or card's channel):
[source,swift]
----
let healthCardResponse = try await selectEsignCommand.transmit(to: Self.healthCard)
guard healthCardResponse.responseStatus == ResponseStatus.success else {
    throw HealthCard.Error.operational // TO-DO: handle this or throw a meaningful Error
}
----


*Following paragraphs describe the deprecated way of executung commands via the _Combine_ inteface:*

A created command can be lifted to the Combine framework with `publisher(for:writetimeout:readtimeout)`.
The result of the command execution can be validated against an expected `ResponseStatus`,
e.g. +SUCCESS+ (+0x9000+).

[source,swift]
----
let publisher: AnyPublisher<HealthCardResponseType, Error> = selectEsignCommand.publisher(for: eGk)
let checkResponse = publisher.tryMap { healthCardResponse -> HealthCardResponseType in
    guard healthCardResponse.responseStatus == ResponseStatus.success else {
        throw HealthCard.Error.operational // throw a meaningful Error
    }
    return healthCardResponse
}
----

===== Create a Command Sequence

It is possible to chain further commands via the `flatMap` operator for subsequent execution:
First create a command and lift it onto a Combine monad, then create a publisher using the `flatMap` operator, e.g.

```
Just(AnyHealthCardCommand.build())
    .flatMap { command in command.pusblisher(for: card) }
```

Eventually use `eraseToAnyPublisher()`.

[source,swift]
----
let readCertificate = checkResponse
    .tryMap { _ -> HealthCardCommandType in
        let sfi = EgkFileSystem.EF.esignCChAutR2048.sfid!
        return try HealthCardCommand.Read.readFileCommand(with: sfi, ne: 0x076C - 1)
    }
    .flatMap { command in
        command.publisher(for: eGk)
    }
    .eraseToAnyPublisher()
----

===== Process Execution result

When the whole command chain is set up we have to subscribe to it.
We really only will receive one value before completion, so something as simple as this `sink()`
convenience publisher is useful.

[source,swift]
----
_ = readCertificate
    .sink(
        receiveCompletion: { completion in
            switch completion {
            case .finished:
                Logger.integrationTest.debug("Completed")
            case let .failure(error):
                Logger.integrationTest.debug("Error: \(error)")
            }
        },
        receiveValue: { healthCardResponse in
            Logger.integrationTest.debug("Got a certifcate")
            let certificate = healthCardResponse.data!
            Logger.integrationTest.debug("Certificate: \(certificate.hexString())")
            // proceed with certificate data here
            // use swiftUI to a show success message on screen etc.
        }
    )
----

[#HealthCardControl]
=== HealthCardControl

This library can be used to realize use cases for interacting with a German Health Card
(eGk, elektronische Gesundheitskarte) via a mobile device.

Typically you would use this library as the high level API gateway for your mobile application
to send predefined command chains to the Health Card and interpret the responses.

For more info, please find the low level part `HealthCardAccess`.
and a https://github.com/gematik/ref-OpenHealthCardApp-iOS[Demo App] on GitHub.

See the https://gematik.github.io/[Gematik GitHub IO] page for a more general overview.


==== Code Samples

Take the necessary preparatory steps for signing a challenge on the Health Card, then sign it.

[source,swift]
----
let challenge = Data([0x0, 0x1, 0x2, 0x3, 0x4, 0x5, 0x6, 0x7, 0x8])
let format2Pin = try Format2Pin(pincode: "123456")
_ = try await Self.healthCard.verifyAsync(pin: format2Pin, type: EgkFileSystem.Pin.mrpinHome)
let signResponse = try await Self.healthCard.signAsync(data: challenge)
expect(signResponse.responseStatus) == ResponseStatus.success
----


Encapsulate the https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Publikationen/TechnischeRichtlinien/tr03110/index_htm.html[PACE protocol]
steps for establishing a secure channel with the Health Card and expose only a simple API call .

[source,swift]
----
let secureMessaging = try await KeyAgreement.Algorithm.idPaceEcdhGmAesCbcCmac128.negotiateSessionKeyAsync(
    card: CardSimulationTerminalTestCase.healthCard,
    can: can,
    writeTimeout: 0,
    readTimeout: 10
)
----

See the integration tests link:include::{integrationtestdir}/HealthCardControl/[IntegrationTests/HealthCardControl/]
for more already implemented use cases.

[#NFCCardReaderProvider]
=== NFCCardReaderProvider

A `CardReaderProvider` implementation that handles the
communication with the Apple iPhone NFC interface.

==== NFCCardReaderSession

For convience, the `NFCCardReaderSession` combines the usage of the NFC inteface with the `HealthCardAccess/HealthCardControl` layers.

The initializer takes some NFC-Display messages, the CAN (card access number) and a closure with a `NFCHealthCardSessionHandle` to send/receive commands/responses to/from the NFC HealthCard and to update the user's interface message to.

[source,swift]
----
guard let nfcHealthCardSession = NFCHealthCardSession(messages: messages, can: can, operation: { session in
    session.updateAlert(message: NSLocalizedString("nfc_txt_msg_verify_pin", comment: ""))
    let verifyPinResponse = try await session.card.verifyAsync(
        pin: format2Pin,
        type: EgkFileSystem.Pin.mrpinHome
    )
    if case let VerifyPinResponse.wrongSecretWarning(retryCount: count) = verifyPinResponse {
        throw NFCSigningFunctionController.Error.wrongPin(retryCount: count)
    } else if case VerifyPinResponse.passwordBlocked = verifyPinResponse {
        throw NFCSigningFunctionController.Error.passwordBlocked
    } else if VerifyPinResponse.success != verifyPinResponse {
        throw NFCSigningFunctionController.Error.verifyPinResponse
    }

    session.updateAlert(message: NSLocalizedString("nfc_txt_msg_signing", comment: ""))
    let outcome = try await session.card.sign(
        payload: "ABC".data(using: .utf8)!, // swiftlint:disable:this force_unwrapping
        checkAlgorithm: checkBrainpoolAlgorithm
    )

    session.updateAlert(message: NSLocalizedString("nfc_txt_msg_success", comment: ""))
    return outcome
})
else {
    // handle the case the Session could not be initialized
----

Execute the operation on the NFC HealthCard. The secure channel (PACE) is established initially before executing the operation.

[source,swift]
----
signedData = try await nfcHealthCardSession.executeOperation()
----

The thrown error will be of type `NFCHealthCardSessionError`.
The `NFCHealthCardSession` also gives you an endpoint to invalidate the underlying `TagReaderSession`.

[source,swift]
----
} catch NFCHealthCardSessionError.coreNFC(.userCanceled) {
    // error type is always `NFCHealthCardSessionError`
    // here we especially handle when the user canceled the session
    Task { @MainActor in self.pState = .idle } // Do some view-property update
    // Calling .invalidateSession() is not strictly necessary
    //  since nfcHealthCardSession does it while it's de-initializing.
    nfcHealthCardSession.invalidateSession(with: nil)
    return
} catch {
    Task { @MainActor in self.pState = .error(error) }
    nfcHealthCardSession.invalidateSession(with: error.localizedDescription)
    return
}
----

[#NFCDemo]
=== NFCDemo

The NFCDemo iOS App target demonstrates the use of OHCKit and the NFCCardReader[Provider] specifically by utilizing
said framework to connect to and establish a secure communications channel with an eGK Card via NFC.

The App consist out of two screens/views. The first one will prompt the user for the CAN number.
The second prompts for the PIN. This PIN is verified on the card against `mrpinHome` when the `connect` button is tapped.
